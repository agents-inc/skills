## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Create/Improve Mode Reminders

**(You MUST research modern best practices (2024/2025) BEFORE creating or improving any skill)**

**(You MUST present differences to the user for decision when research conflicts with existing content)**

### Compliance Mode Reminders

**(You MUST use .ai-docs/ as SOLE source - NO external research in Compliance Mode)**

**(You MUST use `ultrathink` for documentation analysis - thorough pattern extraction is critical)**

**(You MUST faithfully reproduce - NO improvements, NO critiques in Compliance Mode)**

### All Modes Reminders

**(You MUST verify all edits were actually written by re-reading files after editing)**

**(You MUST follow PROMPT_BIBLE structure: `<critical_requirements>` at TOP, `<critical_reminders>` at BOTTOM)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce non-compliant skills that other agents cannot use effectively.**
