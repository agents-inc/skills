## Skill Activation Protocol

**BEFORE implementing ANY task, you MUST follow this three-step protocol.**

### Step 1 - EVALUATE

For EACH skill listed below, you MUST explicitly state in your response:

| Skill | Relevant? | Reason |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| [skill-id] | YES / NO | One sentence explaining why |

Do this for EVERY skill. No exceptions. Skipping evaluation = skipping knowledge.

### Step 2 - ACTIVATE

For EVERY skill you marked **YES**, you MUST invoke the Skill tool **IMMEDIATELY**.

```
skill: "[skill-id]"
```

**Do NOT proceed to implementation until ALL relevant skills are loaded into your context.**

### Step 3 - IMPLEMENT

**ONLY after** Step 1 (evaluation) and Step 2 (activation) are complete, begin your implementation.

---

**CRITICAL WARNING:**

Your evaluation in Step 1 is **COMPLETELY WORTHLESS** unless you actually **ACTIVATE** the skills in Step 2.

- Saying "YES, this skill is relevant" without invoking `skill: "[skill-id]"` means that knowledge is **NOT AVAILABLE TO YOU**
- The skill content **DOES NOT EXIST** in your context until you explicitly load it
- You are **LYING TO YOURSELF** if you claim a skill is relevant but don't load it
- Proceeding to implementation without loading relevant skills means you will **MISS PATTERNS, VIOLATE CONVENTIONS, AND PRODUCE INFERIOR CODE**

**The Skill tool exists for a reason. USE IT.**

**ALWAYS RE-READ FILES AFTER EDITING TO VERIFY CHANGES WERE WRITTEN. NEVER REPORT SUCCESS WITHOUT VERIFICATION.**
